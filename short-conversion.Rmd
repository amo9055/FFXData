Here is some data from Fairfax County. Just a few rows of a very large file!!! This script is adapted from the one Lincoln sent me, to see if I can make changes and still have it work.


```{r}
temp <- read.fwf("short.txt", widths = c(276, 5, 8, 30, 7, 728, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 4, 6, 6), col.names=c("gibberish", "number", "nothing", "street", "type", "stuff", "total.rooms", "total.bed","bath.info", "heat", "air", "num.fplcs", "yr.built", "land.info", "sqft"))

str(temp)



str(temp)
```
